Family Resource Planning
Mission Statement:
The mission of this project is to simplify the hectic lives of a modern family. Each stage of a family's life has its challenges. New couples need to track birthdays, anniversary dates, dinner dates, grocery lists and more. Once you add children to the mix, there exists a need to monitor shot schedules, Dr appointments, feedings, diaper changes, sleep patterns and more. Many users access applications from a myriad of devices. Cross-platform compatibility is a must. Many similar products and projects are incomplete or want payment for necessary features. The goal is to build a system to organize the chaos in an end-to-end manner.  







Currently, this project is in the planning stage.
